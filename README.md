# Fifteen-Puzzle-Game

Fifteen Puzzle Game is one of the classical traditional game. The game was invented by Noyes Palmer Chapman. It is a Sliding Pizzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. We used 4 x 4 size. If its 3 x 3 size then we would call it Eight Puzzle Game. The object of the Puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.
